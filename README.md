# Project Overview
## What is the Project
The aim of this project is to produce a freely available and editable User interface framework which allows for customisability of all aspects of a Module. A module would be a functionality such as:

 •	a word processor.

 •	an mp3 player.
 
 The following traits are examples of customisability:
 
 •	Place controls and information anywhere.
 
 •	Alter the contents of the module itself:
 
 •	Disabling word count.
 
 •	Disabling playback bar in an MP3 player.
 
 •	Adjust appearance of individual information.
 
 •	Change colour.
 
 •	Change size etc.

Ultimately, the intention for this framework is to maximise accessibility for all users.

 
# The Report
The report produced will explain my research and the problem space. I will then take an anylitical look into my development process reviewing decisions i have made discussing the flaws and strengths of the project, which will allow me to continue to develop post submission.
# Project Deliverable
The deliverable for this project comes in three parts
- The Software
- The Documentation
## The Software
The software by April should contain:
- a modularity system which allows for multiple aplications and/or utilities to be displayed on the screen at a single time
- Customisability: Every Aspect of a given module should be customisable from its back ground colour to display shape etc.
- A Word Processor
- The beginings of another Core.Module

## The Documentation
As this is an open source project the quality of documentation is a large part of the deliverable. The goal being to provide useful documentation to both the user and any developers which wish to add on modules .

# What is interesting & useful about this project?
a large amount of the current productivity suite options contain limmited accessibility functionality, with accsess to them being poor as they are usually hidden in a menu. This leads to a large amount of individuals time being spent trying to find the software/feature to solve their needs, e.g a good screen reader, changing background colour etc. The aim of the software is to solve this problem unilatirally whilst also providing a good framework solve future problems in the space

# Project Timetable:
## Phase 1 Deadline: end of November + - 2 weeks
- Research into the problem space
- Submit any necisary ethics aplications and where possible preform the research method
> this is a large element of phase 1 as the problem space is diverse and research avaliblity is low  
- producing solid initial requirements
- some simple UML class diagrams
- Setting Methodologies & tests
- Writing as much of the report as possible
- Producing a summary to help with stage 2
## Phase 2 Deadline: end of Febuary + - 2 weeks
- Reflection on stage 1
- development of the UI framework & Word Processor
- Unit testing
- Start to write the development section of the report laregely focussed on development methodology and problems faced so far
- Core.Module testing
- Summarise for phase 2.5
## Phase 2.5 Deadline: Mid march  +- 1 week
> the seperation here is due to the diffrence in aims, there is laregley development tasks and organisation tasks split here, this is due to the fact it allows for a time to gather thoughts and prioritise 
- Refelct on phase 2 
- Produce Documentation
- Organising artifacts
- Producing refence table
- Producing Summary to aid with phase 3
## Phase 3 - Deadline 15th April +- 1 week
- Reflection on phase 2.5
- Systems testing
- Finalising report
## Post Submission
- Summarising for phase 4
### Phase 4 Reccuring
- Reflection on previous Stage
- adding or improving functionality 
- Produce Documentation
- Summarise Stage
