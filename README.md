# Project Overview
## What is the Project
The project is an open source productivity suite designed to be modular and accessible for as many individuals as possible with customisability being at its core. It has been produced as a part of coursework but i hope to maintain it after the fact, both to work as a protfolio but also because i believe a system like this is needed

## Ethos


# Project Deliverable
The deliverable for this project comes in three parts
- The Report
- The Software
- The Documentation

## The Report
This report will contain a documentation of development including decisions made, struggles faced.

## The Software
The software by April should contain:
- a modularity system which allows for multiple aplications and/or utilities to be displayed on the screen at a single time
- Customisability: Every Aspect of a given module should be customisable from its back ground colour to display shape etc.
- A Word Processor
- The beginings of another Module

## The Documentation
As this is an open source project the quality of documentation is a large part of the deliverable, the goal here is to be able to provide documetnation to not only use the system but also to create new modules that the user might desire 

# What is interesting & useful about this project?
mass market productivity software in general have not undergone a wide redisign since the 90s and are laregley focussed on compatabilty, beyond this there accessability is limmited and usaully burried in menues, the goal of this project is to redesign and consolidate productivity suites into one simple easy to use aplication that is open source to allow for wide adoption and customisation
