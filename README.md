# Project Overview
## What is the Project
The softwares main purpose is to produce a open source UI framework which allows for customisability of all elements within a given Module - a module in this sence would be a functionality e.g. a word processor, mp3 player etc - this will include button size, colour e.t.c. The aim being increasing Accssessability for all users. 
# The Report
The report produced will explain my research and the problem space. I will then take an anylitical look into my development process reviewing decisions i have made discussing the flaws and strengths of the project, which will allow me to continue to develop post submission.
# Project Deliverable
The deliverable for this project comes in three parts
- The Software
- The Documentation
over the course of development this should allow a developer to understand the decisions ive made and why 

## The Software
The software by April should contain:
- a modularity system which allows for multiple aplications and/or utilities to be displayed on the screen at a single time
- Customisability: Every Aspect of a given module should be customisable from its back ground colour to display shape etc.
- A Word Processor
- The beginings of another Module

## The Documentation
As this is an open source project the quality of documentation is a large part of the deliverable. The goal being to provide useful documentation to both the user and any developers which wish to add on modules .

# What is interesting & useful about this project?
a large amount of the current productivity suite options contain limmited accessibility functionality, with accsess to them being relativly awkward due to the fact that it is usually hidden in a menu somewhere. this leads to a large amount of individuals time being spent trying to find sthe software/feature to solve their needs, e.g a good screen reader, changing background colour etc


mass market productivity software in general have not undergone a wide redisign since the 90s and are laregley focussed on backwards-compatabilty, beyond this the problem space has limmited accessability functionality, which is usaully burried in menues.
